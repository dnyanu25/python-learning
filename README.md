# 🧠 Python Learning & AI Agent Foundations

This repository documents my step-by-step learning journey in **Python** and **AI Agent development**.  
It starts from core Python fundamentals and progresses toward **agent-oriented programming**, preparing a strong base for **multi-agent systems**.

---

## 📌 Level 1: Python Basics (Core Foundation)
 
### 1️⃣ Print & Variables
- Printed basic output
- Used variables to store data
- Took user input using `input()`

**Concepts learned:**
- `print()`
- Variables
- User input handling

---

### 2️⃣ Data Types & Type Conversion
- Identified Python data types
- Converted string to integer

**Concepts learned:**
- `int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`
- `type()` function
- Type casting

---

### 3️⃣ Conditional Statements
- Checked positive or negative numbers
- Checked even or odd numbers
- Built basic condition-based command handling

**Concepts learned:**
- `if`, `else`, `elif`
- Logical operators
- User input decision making

---

### 4️⃣ Loops
- Printed numbers from 1 to 10
- Printed even numbers from 1 to 20
- Repeated agent status messages

**Concepts learned:**
- `for` loop
- `while` loop
- Iteration logic

---

## 📌 Level 2: Logic Building (Agent Thinking)

### 5️⃣ Functions
- Created reusable functions
- Built square and greeting functions
- Implemented prime number logic

**Concepts learned:**
- Function definition
- Parameters & return values
- Problem-solving logic

---

### 6️⃣ Lists
- Created task lists
- Added new tasks dynamically
- Iterated through lists

**Concepts learned:**
- Lists
- `.append()`
- Looping through collections

---

### 7️⃣ Dictionaries (Agent Memory Concept)
- Stored agent data using key-value pairs
- Updated agent state dynamically
- Iterated over dictionary items

**Concepts learned:**
- Dictionaries
- Agent state tracking
- Key-value memory representation

---

## 📌 Level 3: Agent-Oriented Programming Basics ⭐

### 8️⃣ Object-Oriented Programming (Agent Creation)
- Created an `Agent` class
- Used constructor (`__init__`)
- Defined agent behavior using methods

**Concepts learned:**
- Classes & objects
- Methods
- Object state

---

### 9️⃣ Decision-Based Agent
- Agent responds based on commands
- Implements decision logic internally

**Concepts learned:**
- Command-based execution
- Agent behavior modeling

---

### 🔟 Exception Handling
- Handled invalid user input safely

**Concepts learned:**
- `try` / `except`
- Safe execution

---

### 1️⃣1️⃣ File Handling
- Wrote agent logs to a file
- Read file content

**Concepts learned:**
- File I/O
- Persistent storage basics

---

## 🎯 Key Learning Outcomes

- Strong Python fundamentals
- Logical thinking and problem solving
- Understanding how **AI agents work internally**
- Basics of agent memory and state
- Foundation for **multi-agent systems**
